 Built a Rust-based email header parsing library, extracting structured metadata with IndexMap for efficient lookups.  
 Implemented state-machine logic to handle folded headers, multi-line values, and invalid transitions in real-world messages.  
 Integrated custom RFC 2047 decoder for Base64 and Quoted-Printable encodings, ensuring accurate multilingual header parsing.  
 Delivered tested, modular components supporting header iteration, case-insensitive lookups, and seamless decoding for scalable backend applications.
